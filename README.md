# Module 15 challenge: bikesharing

Overview:
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate NYC's Bike Sharing Data (Aug. 2019 dataset) and put together a business proposal for a similar model in Des Moines. We will be using Tableau to visualize the dataset to answer some questions that investors might have.

Results:
The insights from the data and visuals indicate that a major of the users are male subscribers. We can infer by looking at the “Peak riding hours”, “Weekday trips by hour and Gender” and “Top Starting Location” charts that the bikes are heavily used during rush hours (7-9am & 5-7pm) in the mid to downtown area of Manhattan. The duration of rides usually peak at around 10+ minutes then it drops significantly. The data also shows there’s a good usage of the bikes during the weekends as well.

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

Summary:
Based on the findings from the NYC dataset, we can propose a similar model in the downtown/business district of Des Moines. We can build bike stations in the vicinity of high density housing that are within 10/15 min of bike ride to the business district of the city. 

These additional insights would be useful to have to help with the proposal:
	- Subscription cost vs. cost per ride for non-subs.
	- Population density to the # of bikes available to a neighborhood
